## Hii, my name is Justin Ignatius Tjitra!
---
Iâ€™m a passionate game programmer specializing in developing 2D games using Unity. I have a strong foundation in basic game mechanics, scripting, and design. I enjoy working with others in terms of collaborative and teamwork to contribute in any projects. </br>

I've actively participated in multiple game development competitions. From there I gained valuable experiences, making an engaging gameplay either for entertainment purpose or public benefit purpose.

# Down below are some of the games I have made so far, feel free to try :D
